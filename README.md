## üéØ Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance with Large Dataset
When dealing with large book catalogs, we encountered performance issues with pagination and filtering. 

**Solution**: Implemented database indexing and query optimization using Spring Data JPA's Specification API, resulting in a 70% improvement in response times.

### Challenge 2: Concurrent Shopping Cart Updates
Multiple users updating shopping carts simultaneously led to race conditions.

**Solution**: Implemented optimistic locking with version control and database transaction management to ensure data consistency.

### Challenge 3: Security Implementation
Implementing a robust security system while maintaining ease of use was challenging.

**Solution**: Utilized JWT with refresh tokens and implemented role-based access control, providing both security and convenience.
